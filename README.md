# mouse-dvd
hadn't seen somebody do this before, plus i did it with ctypes because i like using base modules where i can (yet again, school pc restrictions made me this way)

it turns the mouse into a dvd screensaver and counts wall/corner hits (although good luck getting the latter unless you're super lucky; the cursor is technically 1x1 so it follows a pattern as opposed to the actual dvd screensaver being more random)

stop with ctrl+c while focused on the shell
